  		<h1>Two-Thirds of States Are Hit With Oyster Related Illnesses </h1>

				<p>
					Americans love oysters, consuming 42.3 million pounds of the bivalves annually. Oysters are harvested domestically from coastal states, and are also imported from six countries, the majority of which come from Canada and Korea. Due to our food distribution system, a batch of contaminated oysters can affect consumers in many states before the source is found and contained. 

	</p>

<!--Graf on alerts & illnesses-->

<p> The FDA has issued 22 alerts, advisories, and recalls of oysters from April  2022 through August 2024. These safety alerts affected 37 states and resulted in over 1,000 documented illnesses. 

California, New York, and Florida were affected in nearly half of the recalls. In 2023, one batch of Korean oysters caused 33 people in San Diego alone to become ill from contaminated oysters and resulted in recalls in five states.

<p> The widespread impact of how our food is distributed and the impact of human contamination is perhaps best exemplified by an outbreak that occurred from contaminated Canadian oysters. At least 176 Canadians and 100 Americans were confirmed to have been infected with the norovirus from oysters harvested in British Columbia. The oysters were distributed to eight states, resulting in international and multi-state illnesses. 

<br>

<br>

Canada’s Center for Disease Control investigated and ultimately found the most likely source of contamination stemmed from anchored commercial fishing vessels that discharged the boat's sewage waste into the water. 


<br>

<br>

“It’s a human problem,” said <a href="https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=4361" > Dr. Timothy Green</a>, PhD and Chair of shellfish health and genomics at Vancouver Island University in Canada. “For some reason in North America, we just don’t want to take care of our wastewater.” 

<br>

<br>

Although not the most dangerous, as compared to vibrio, norovirus is the most prevalent virus found in the data on oyster related illnesses. In the Pacific Northwest, norovirus spikes in the winter for a number of reasons. 

<br>

<br>

Firstly, UV rays from the sun tend to kill the virus in the water. Secondly, as more people are indoors and tend to get the virus in the winter, it ends up in wastewater treatment plans and subsequently in our environment, thereby contaminating shellfish growing in ocean waters. Lastly, when norovirus enters coastal ocean waters it is estimated to remain viable for four to six weeks in the water system. Dr. Green uses the example that if an individual who is ill with norovirus flushes a toilet or vomits over the side of a boat, and that boat empties its waste into coastal waters, the virus from that one individual can stay in the water column for over a month. 

<br>


<br>

An outbreak can occur quickly when infected oysters are harvested and distributed across multiple states. Dr. Green says bureaucracy between government agencies, each claiming lack of responsibility or claiming the issue is outside of their purview, is contributing to the problem. Until these issues are resolved via legislative, commerical, and environmental policies, we will continue to see the impact on a multi-state level. 


<br>

<br>

“Who wants to really be swimming around in poop, that’s really what norovirus is signaling,” said Dr. Green. “We’re not going to solve every norovirus outbreak, but we certainly should be able to reduce the number of big outbreaks.”
